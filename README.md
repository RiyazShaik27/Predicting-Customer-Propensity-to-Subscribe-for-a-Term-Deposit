## 💡 Project Overview

[cite_start]This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify which bank clients are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit[cite: 100]. [cite_start]The primary goal is to use a data-driven approach to optimize marketing campaigns, increase their efficiency and return on investment (ROI), and enable more personalized and targeted marketing efforts[cite: 8].

## 🚀 Actionable Insights

The analysis identified several key factors that influence a client's decision to subscribe, providing valuable insights for business strategy.

* [cite_start]**Engagement is Key**: 🗣️ The single most influential factor is the **duration** of the last contact[cite: 109], which suggests that quality and length of interaction are more predictive of success than any demographic or financial attribute.
* [cite_start]**Past Success Predicts Future Success**: ✅ Clients who had a positive outcome in a previous campaign (`poutcome_success`) are more likely to subscribe again[cite: 91].
* [cite_start]**Financial Health Matters**: 💰 Clients with higher account balances are more inclined to invest[cite: 92], which is a data-backed intuitive finding.
* [cite_start]**Targeting Recommendations**: 🎯 To increase conversion rates, marketing messages should be tailored based on demographic features like age and job type[cite: 118]. [cite_start]The typical client is around 41 years old, married, and has a secondary level of education[cite: 107].

Here are the key files included in this repository:

1.  **Customer Propensity Model Analysis Notebook**: The main Jupyter Notebook file (`Customer Propensity Model Analysis Notebook.ipynb`) contains all the code for the project. [cite_start]It includes steps for data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building using a **Random Forest Classifier**[cite: 104].
2.  **Customer Propensity Model Report**: A detailed PDF report (`Customer_Propensity_Model_Report.pdf`) that summarizes the project's methodology, key findings, and model performance. [cite_start]The model achieved a high ROC AUC score of 0.92, demonstrating its strong ability to distinguish between subscribers and non-subscribers[cite: 74, 113, 114].
3.  **Presentation File**: A presentation file (`Predicting Customer Propensity to Subscribe for a Term Deposit.pptx`) that highlights the project's objectives, data insights, and the final results in a concise visual format.
